       My life is very complicated since I was very child, Olongapo City Elem. School I've so much into trouble throughout Kinder and Grade periods<br>
       But, I have so many friend around 10 of them. We usually run around, play hide and seek, and always having just fun until the graduation.<br><br>

       In my highschool years of Jackson HS, I usually get into trouble but not quite much that happened. Since my old friends are all go somewhere in<br>
       other places, I got bored and went to a Vocal class in the Special Program Curriculum. There where I develop my singing skill for the past<br>
       four years to developed into perfection, but sometime when I was bored, I was usually play a piano, drawing in my notebook, and writing stories.<br><br>

       Before I went to go to Senior Highschool, and during summer vacation of 2018, I flew to America for the first time outside of the country. Sure, I<br>
       went other places like the Bangui Windmills, Pagudpud, Vigan, Sagada, and Baguio in the North, The Mt. Mayon, Naga City, and Batangas in the South.<br>
       and frequently places like Pampanga, Zambales, and Metro Manila. But go to America is very foreign and unfamiliar to me. I can get the longest day<br>
       throughout the summer like we spent all "night" until the sun is set at 9pm, which is very crazy as the one who lived in the tropical for so long.<br>
       While I was in America, I'm traveling around with my brother, like San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Rosa, Loma Linda and many more.<br>
       I can chance to meet my relatives that from both my motherside and my fatherside, and they're always friendly, especially my uncles, my aunts<br>
       and my cousins. And also this is where my eldest brother met her girlfriend that soon to be married.<br><br>

       And lastly my Senior Highschool years, I was a STEM student in Gordon College for the past 2 years, my brain is starting to mature a little bit and<br>
       spent my time in the class, and also I'm a good dancer and giving the highest grade above 95 which is very surprised that most of my school grades<br>
       are below 80, and I must keep moving forward in my life in the end of the day.
